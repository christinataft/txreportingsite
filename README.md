# txreportingsite

There is now a law in effect in Texas where you cannot get an abortion after 6 weeks, and there is a website where you can report doctors performing abortions. I wrote a bot that will fill out the form every minute. It types out the responses slowly and goes to the next text box every few seconds to mimic a human so it passes the Captcha. However, the website has been updated to not show the form to people outside of Texas. I connected to a VPN in Texas, and while it works when I load it in my browser, it won't load in my testing suite, meaning I've been unable to test about half of my code. I thought I would upload it to Github in case anyone is interested in it, and theoretically it should all work, but I can't guarantee it.
